We may use this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.
        </p>
        <h3 class="private-head">WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h3>

        <h3 class="private-head">COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to access or store information. Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Easy Pro Forma LLC d/b/a What Song) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>
        <p>We do not currently use first party cookies. Some third party cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services. Third parties serve cookies through our Services for analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
        </p>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services. You may set or amend your device or web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h3>
        <p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in these facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your information.</p>
        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>We will only keep your information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will delete it.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
        <p>We use reputable, industry-standard, third-party services that utilize certain information for proper app functioning, such as Apple and Google. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">MINORS</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@easyproforma.com.
        </p>
        <h3 class="private-head">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
        <p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>
        <p>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.
        </p>
        <h3 class="private-head">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>
        <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
        <h3 class="private-head">MISC.</h3>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time with or without notice to you. The updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at info@easyproforma.com.</p>
